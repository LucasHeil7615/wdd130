<h3>Hi I identifiy as a human or terran</h3>
<p>I'm here with my wife Kc and our cats Milo & Leia. The "kittens" are both about 1/2 of a year old. 
    Kc & I just joyfuly celebrated our 1st anaverssary on april 8th. 
    We hail from the beutiful state of California in Costa Mesa 
half way between the beach and disneyland. So why would I move my family up here?</p>
<p>I came here to pursue a varitey of things. Though I'm a returned missionary my own testimony has always been challenged
back in So cal. I come from a family that has mixed feelings about the church half love it some don't see the benefit"
I came to BYU Idaho aka "Rexbuurrrrg" so I could provided a better life for us in a few diffrent ways.
<li>1st I'm here to strengthen my testimony of the church and to be a light for my extended family. 
I know the priciples that are taught here can help us all find peace.</li> 
<li>2nd I'm pursuing Computer Engineering as my major. It may change to electrical engineering but we'll see.</li>
<li>3rd I'm here to network and collaborate with You!!</li>
<p>I'm intereted in making some new friends and to explore this new world of computers.
    With that in mind what makes me Lucas? My hobbies and interesets of course!
I love to play video games such as Minecraft, Terraria, Portal 1&2, anything to do with starwars, and most open world RPG's.
I also enjoy bird watching, listening to Lofi, classic rock; anything peaceful or energizing; and playing amature hour pool.
 Growing up I played 12 years of baseball and 4 years of football and enjoy watching a game or 2 now. Between dogs and cats I grew up with 2 dogs and fell in love with cats on my mission so I think they are both great in aunique way. As a far as ice cream goes,
anything that's creamy with little bits of chocolate in it tastes delicous.</p>
